                <h4>About us</h4>
                <p>We VanHub are one of the well known cart in this vast growing food cart business in sylhet.
                    Situated in Majortila( infront of Al amin jameya school). 
                    Our little journey started back on 7th of august, 2019.
                    we were all students and aspiring to be part of a start-up that'll
                    cover for the timely allowance we get from our family, also
                    have a fixed spot for all of us to hangout.
                    Thus the idea cranked up from there. And VanHub became a lot of
                    peoples favorite hangout spot. 
                    We ensure good  quality food and humble service to our beloved customers.
                    Till date untill updating this little introductory of ours, we VanHub went through a lot over the years.
                    And now are one of the longest running cart in this beautiful city. And when we say went through a lot, the line emphasises mainly on pre and post covid-19 lockdown. 
                    Since then, our profits have dipped bit but no compromise has been made when it comes to our quality. 
                    And we are still going strenght to strength because of the love and affections we are receving from our beloved customers.
                    And we hope that you guys will always keep us in your prayers.</p>
